# Project Title

Tic Tac Toe AI

## Description

This is a Python project that uses recursion to iterate through all possible scenarios of the game and stores each of them in a tree structure.
Each node in the tree has a number value representing the likelihood for the computer to win. The computer then uses the minimax search algorithm to search through this tree to
pick out its next best moves as the game progresses.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

* execute the main.py file
* type the number corresponding to the space you want to place your move in
